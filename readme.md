Change Log
----------
01/09/10 - v0.1 -> Initial beta release.

03/09/10 - v0.1 -> v0.2 -> Setting added to stop users choosing how thread statuses are displayed, and also added the ability to force a display style on current users. Fixed a bug where support/assigned/technical threads lists would show incorrect/irrelevant threads. To upgrade, deactivate MySupport, reupload ./inc/plugins/mysupport.php, ./admin/modules/config/mysupport.php, and ./inc/languages/english/admin/config_mysupport.lang.php, activate MySupport.

08/09/10 - v0.2 -> v0.3 -> Few code improvements. Added text to best answer/support denial links in posts. Implemented inline thread moderation; add/change status/assigned user/priority/category of multiple threads via the forum display/search results. Fixed bug where mod log actions would be double escaped, and where MySupport information shown in search results wouldn't be unset properly, causing problems if the forum of the next thread in the list wasn't a MySupport forum. To upgrade, deactivate MySupport, reupload ./inc/plugins/mysupport.php and ./inc/languages/english/mysupport.lang.php, activate MySupport.

28/09/10 - v0.3 -> v0.4 -> Tweaked display of best answer and support denial links in posts. Doesn't show status/assign info for sticky threads. Bugs fixed: Some table columns were too small; breadcrumb/table header would be incomplete on support denial page if no UID was given; inline thread moderation options would show even if MySupport wasn't enabled in that forum, would show in search results if no forums had MySupport enabled, and didn't check if selected threads were in MySupport forums when selected via inline thread moderation on search results; priorities with a space in the name wouldn't highlight the thread on the forum display; best answer/staff highlighting would override the unapproved post shade; support denial link would show in the posts of staff; list of support threads would load unapproved threads; wouldn't be able to deny support with a reason if you had more than one reason specified; list of threads with a particular priority in the ACP wouldn't load the correct threads. Missed htmlspecialchars_uni() in an ACP table and the priority classes. To upgrade, deactivate MySupport, reupload ./inc/plugins/mysupport.php, ./admin/modules/config/mysupport.php, ./inc/languages/english/mysupport.lang.php, and ./inc/languages/english/admin/config_mysupport.lang.php, activate MySupport.
